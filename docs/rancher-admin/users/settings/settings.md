Within Rancher, each user has a number of settings associated with their login: personal preferences, API keys, etc. You can configure these settings by choosing from the **User Settings** menu. You can open this menu by clicking your avatar, located within the main menu.

The available user settings are:

- [API & Keys](../../user/settings/api-keys.md): If you want to interact with Rancher programmatically, you need an API key. Follow the directions in this section to obtain a key.
- [Cloud Credentials](../../user/settings/manage-cloud-credentials.md): Manage cloud credentials [used by node templates](../../../cluster-deployment/infra-providers/infra-providers.md#node-templates) to [provision nodes for clusters](../../../cluster-deployment/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.md).
- [Node Templates](../../user/settings/manage-node-templates.md): Manage templates [used by Rancher to provision nodes for clusters](../../../cluster-deployment/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher.md).
- [Preferences](../../user/settings/user-preferences.md): Sets superficial preferences for the Rancher UI.
